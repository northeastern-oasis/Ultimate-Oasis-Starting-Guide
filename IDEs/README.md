# Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)Your IDE (integrated development environment) is what you will use to write/edit code for projects throughout the workshop series. There are many great options out there, with modern editors offering advanced code completion, refactoring, searching, and analyzing capabilities. You only need one, so if you haven’t used one before we would recommend one of the following## Visual Studio Code ([https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/))Choose this if you’ve never used an IDE (besides Dr. Racket) before. Maintained by Microsoft, it is 100% free and has a simple interface that is easy to get started with.## Jetbrains Webstorm ([https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/))This powerful IDE offers many advanced features for working with web development “out of the box”--without major configuration required. It is slightly more sophisticated and and resource-intensive than more lightweight editors like VS code, but is built on the JetBrains platform so if you’ve used editors like IntelliJ this should be familiar to you.**Note:** while this software costs money, all Jetbrains products can be accessed for free with a student license ([https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students))## Notepad++ ([https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/))Despite being one of the most lightweight editors, Notepad++ is very functional and perfectly suitable for basic web development. Needless to say, the aforementioned editors come with more bells and whistles—most prominently excellent autocomplete and code-checking features—but if you want to dive in without training wheels or have a less powerful this is a good option
