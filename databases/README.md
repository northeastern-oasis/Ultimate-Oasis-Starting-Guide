# DatabasesAlmost all applications that allow users to create accounts, make postings, or even just provide a store of information likely share a certain commonality: they utilize a database solution, often hosted in the cloud. Database solutions provide your application the functionality of storing, referencing, updating, and deleting information in a persistent store that can live on your machine or a remote server. The following sections summarize the two main types of database solutions, as well as some popular products of that type. All of the mentioned products have free/community options that are more than sufficient for you to get started with your project## SQL DatabasesSQL database solutions use SQL (structured query language) to interact with them. Compared to NoSQL databases, SQL databases are generally more structured, larger, and more stable.SQL databases require that a schema be defined that outlines what tables will exist, what fields (columns) each table will have, and what type of data will be stored for each field. For example, a schema might define a table called “Users” with three fields called “Name,” “Age,” and “isSubscribed” that store string, number, and boolean data, respectively.Different tables can be connected by means of relations that connect entries from one table to those in another. For example, a table called “Users” may have a field called “ID” as its _primary key_—a main identifying field—that connects its entries to entries in a table called “Purchases”, which has a field called “buyerID” as its _foreign key_—a field that references an entry’s primary key in another table.### Popular SQL Database Solutions:#### PostgreSQL:*   Initial release: 1996*   Companies using: Apple, BioPharm, Etsy, IMDB*   Learn more: [https://www.postgresql.org/about/](https://www.postgresql.org/about/)*   Free download: [https://www.postgresql.org/download/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)#### MySQL:*   Initial release: 1995*   Companies using: Facebook, Google, Adobe, Spotify*   Learn more: [https://www.mysql.com/why-mysql/](https://www.mysql.com/why-mysql/)*   Free download: [https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) (install the community server and workbench)## NoSQL DatabasesNoSQL databases (surprisingly) do not use SQL to interact with them, but rather a different syntax that depends on which database solution is being used. Instead of the tables SQL databases use, they have _collections_ which store lists of _documents_ that look like [JSON objects](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp). NoSQL databases lack schemas, so the documents can hold any fields you want and don’t have to have the same data as other documents in the same collection (but you might want them to for ease of use).Compared to SQL databases, NoSQL databases are generally easier to use and more intuitive. They are able to more quickly access huge collections of data. However, they can be unpredictable since there is no way to know the documents you access through them have the data you’re expecting.### Popular NoSQL Database Solutions:#### MongoDB:*   Initial release: 2009*   Companies using: AstraZeneca, Ebay, VSCO*   Learn more: [https://www.mongodb.com/what-is-mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/what-is-mongodb)*   Free Download: [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)#### Firebase Firestore:*   Initial release: 2012*   Companies using: Twitch, Instacart, Accenture*   Learn more: [https://firebase.google.com/products#develop-products](https://firebase.google.com/products#develop-products)*   Free Start: [https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/overview?purchaseBillingPlan=free](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/overview?purchaseBillingPlan=free)
