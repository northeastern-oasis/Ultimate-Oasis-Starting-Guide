# Intro to the WebOne of the most prevalent actions we take is also one of the least understood--using the Internet, be it to search a burning question, engage in a virtual conversation, or using a full-featured application. Throughout the semester, we will be looking more into how these types of tools are created and built some of our own. But first, it is useful to gain a fundamental understanding how the web actually works and take a look at its core building blocks that make up everything we know. These resources are a good place to start to gain this fundamental knowledge ## How the web works: behind the scenesWhen we enter a website address in our browser, all we see is a loading screen and the eventual loaded page. Behind the scenes, however, a lot is going on to make this process fast and seamless. Understanding what happens here will not only make you a more informed netizen, but also serve as a foundation for your web development journey. **How the Internet Works (Code.org)***   [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfMRZm5DDxco3UdsFegvuB7](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfMRZm5DDxco3UdsFegvuB7)**How the Internet Works (MDN)***   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work)## HTML, JavaScript, and CSS: The building blocks of the webThese “Languages of the Web” are what most code written will be written in with any of the following. They are built into any modern web browser and for the most part control what you see on any page; code written with framework- or library-specific syntax ultimately compiles to plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Thus, having at least a passing familiarity with all three is crucial before diving into them.### HTML*   **Initial release**: 1993*   **Maintained by**: World Wide Web Consortium*   **Tutorial**: [https://www.w3schools.com/html/](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)    HTML (hypertext markup language) is a markup language that can be used to describe the structure of a web page. A typical HTML document will consist of many “tags”, which represent elements in a page and each have a name representing what it is, surrounded by angle brackets. For example &lt;p> represents a paragraph in a page. Some tags will also add properties that further specify what they should look like. For example, &lt;img src=”pic.png”> is an image and the image it will display is a file called “pic.png”. Although there are many tags in HTML, only ~10 or so will really need to be learned to be comfortable writing HTML code.CSS*   **Initial release**: 1996*   **Maintained by**: World Wide Web Consortium*   **Tutorial**: [https://www.w3schools.com/css/](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)    CSS (cascading style sheets) is a style sheet language that is used to describe what HTML elements should look like. CSS is like the buttons at the top of a Word document that let you change things like text color, margins, boldfacing, and text size, but with far more control and options. At its most basic, CSS “code” is a list of rules that change the look of HTML elements in the same way a text editor allows you to—changing the color and size of text, the background color of the page, the width and height of content areas, etc. More advanced CSS code can be used to create page animations, 3D effects, and layouts that rearrange for different screen sizes. Although there are hundreds of CSS rules, only a handful really need to be committed to memory—most frontend developers using it consult documentation often.JavaScript*   **Initial release**: 1996*   **Maintained by**: World Wide Web Consortium*   **Tutorial**: [https://www.w3schools.com/js/](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)    JavaScript is best described as the language of the web—a programming language that is built into every major web browser and powers almost every major website today. Developed back in 1996 as a language that could handle errors gracefully while running in web browsers, it is a high-level language with a beginner-friendly syntax. It can be used in web pages to add form validation, fetch data to render in a page, add complex animations, and much more. It can also run on a server behind-the-scenes using technologies such as Node.js.
