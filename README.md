![Oasis Logo](./oasis_logo.png)

## What is this?
This is a guide for anyone interested in learning more about web development and tangential topics. It was created for participants of Oasis at Northeastern University, but all are welcome to benefit from and share it. As noted below, it is always a work in progress and we encourage additions to the resources we have curated here.

## How do I use this?
We hope this guide serves as a first destination for anyone planning to venture into a new topic realiting to full stack development. The Internet is filled with excellent resources for learning the topics we've outlined, and we believe we have collected some of the best for your benefit. Feel free to learn more about a topic you're familiar with or venture into a new one!
