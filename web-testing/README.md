# Web TestingNo matter which language we are using—Racket, Java, JavaScript, Python, etc—testing our code is important we should try to do so as much as possible. Debugging is also a necessary part of the development process that we will undoubtedly need to partake in. Luckily we have many options for testing and debugging at our disposal, ranging from writing unit tests with frameworks like Jest to inspecting our code in-browser to even adding type checking. Ideally, you will utilize elements from multiple of the below categories in your development process## Testing FrameworksTesting frameworks allow us to write code that makes sure other code we have written works as expected. While an extra step in the development process, they help us catch avoidable errors with our code by forcing us to carefully determine what the outcome of the code should be and ensuring that is what happens. Most follow a structure of having us describe what the code should do, and then asserting that is what happens when we run it. All are easy to get started with in a new project or integrate with an existing project. Following are some of the most popular ones to use:### Jest*   **Site:** [https://jestjs.io/](https://jestjs.io/)*   **NPM:** [https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest)*   **Best suited for:** React apps*   **Good tutorial:** [https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-testing-and-debugging/linting-with-eslint](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-testing-and-debugging/linting-with-eslint)### Jasmine*   **Site:** [https://jasmine.github.io/](https://jasmine.github.io/)*   **NPM:** [https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine)*   **Best suited for:** General frontend testing*   **Good tutorial:** [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jasminejs/index.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jasminejs/index.htm)### Cypress*   **Site:** [https://www.cypress.io/](https://www.cypress.io/)*   **NPM:** [https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress)*   **Best suited for:** Frontend web applications*   **Good tutorial:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dr10Z-HpsCQ&list=PL8GlT7H3xOcKBEDLXwJPE1jwZ_Z4oh6Rk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dr10Z-HpsCQ&list=PL8GlT7H3xOcKBEDLXwJPE1jwZ_Z4oh6Rk)### Mocha*   **Site:** [https://mochajs.org/](https://mochajs.org/)*   **NPM:** [https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha)*   **Best suited for:** Frontend+backend testing*   **Good tutorial:** [https://mochajs.org/#getting-started](https://mochajs.org/#getting-started)### Which One to Use?As you may have learned by now, there are a lot of JavaScript libraries out there...and by that we mean there are a TON! There are typically many that seem to perform the same task, and they all claim to be the best at what they do, so which one to go with? The answer is...it doesn't matter a whole lot. You could waste a lot of time deliberating or just jump right in and start developing. There are, however, two things to watch out for. Firstly, make sure that it does accomplish what you are looking for. If you want to run tests on the backend, not all of these libraries are adept at that. Secondly, you want to make sure the library is updated frequently. If they are open source (which most are) and the Github repository hasn’t been updated in 2 years, that might not be the best choice. Since the web changes rapidly, any technology built for it must be kept constantly up-to-date.## Type CheckingUnlike testing frameworks and debugging tools, type checking acts more as error prevention than identification. JavaScript being a dynamically typed language, variables can hold any type of value at initialization and can even change the type of value they are holding at different points in the program. Vanilla JavaScript does not give us a way to reliably expect a variable to be of a certain type in the way statically typed languages like Java do. Type checking systems help solve this problem. Two of the most popular are as follow:### Flow:*   Site: [https://flow.org/](https://flow.org/)*   Setup: [https://flow.org/en/docs/install/](https://flow.org/en/docs/install/)*   Learning curve: BeginnerFlow is a static JavaScript type checker started by Facebook that uses annotations, meaning within your code you use Flow-specific syntax to say what type variables should be. If you deviate in your code from the types you annotated—for example, by assigning a number variable to a string value—Flow will warn you of this problem before the program runs. Before the program runs, however, all Flow annotations are removed from it so no type checking actually happens while the program runs. Flow is easy to get started with or integrate into an existing project, so it is worth checking out if you are curious.### TypeScript:*   Site: [https://www.typescriptlang.org/](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)*   Setup: [https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)*   Learning curve: IntermediateTypeScript is an open-source project led by Microsoft that has become immensely popular in recent years. TypeScript is a little different, and a lot more powerful than Flow. It is actually a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to it, which means that TypeScript code is not JavaScript code but turns into it once run through the TypeScript compiler. This being the case, however, TypeScript has liberty to add lots of cool features that aren’t in JavaScript but can make your coding time a lot easier, such as enums and interfaces. However, it is a bit more difficult to incorporate in an existing project and has a bit of a learning curve, so is not recommended if you are a relatively new JavaScript programmer.
