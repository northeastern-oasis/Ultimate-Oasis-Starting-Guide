# Frontend Web DevelopmentIn a web application, the frontend is the main visual component. All the stuff you can see, scroll, swipe, and click—the front end of your application will define these elements. There are many different tools available (most for free!) to help you build your application's frontend, each with different syntax and levels of community support. It can be difficult at first, even for experienced developers, to choose the right frontend technology for the job.  But don’t worry! Although they all take different approaches to it, each of the following libraries and frameworks accomplishes the same task—building a beautiful, simple, and interactive interface for your users—so get coding!# Popular Frontend Frameworks 2020The following libraries and frameworks are not only for the most part quick and easy to get started with but also highly popular, with huge online communities for support and comprehensive, easy-to-follow documentation. ## React*   **Initial release**: May 2013*   **Maintained by**: Facebook (open source)*   **Languages used**: JavaScript, CSS, JSX (HTML-like syntax used only by React)*   **Companies/apps using**: Netflix, Dropbox, Facebook, Pinterest, Udemy*   **Ease of use**: BeginnerReact is a frontend library that has exploded in popularity in recent years and allows developers to easily create components which react to user input and changes in app data and can be reused across applications. React components can be used for just a small feature of your app or the entire thing can be a React component. Either way, React makes it easier to resuse code and structure your apps. In addition, React can be used to create mobile applications through technologies such as [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)### Helpful Resources:*   Concepts:    *   [Official Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)*   Tutorials:    *   [http://auth0.com/blog/react-tutorial-building-and-securing-your-first-app/](http://auth0.com/blog/react-tutorial-building-and-securing-your-first-app/)    *   [https://www.robinwieruch.de/learn-react-js](https://www.robinwieruch.de/learn-react-js)*   Examples:    *   [https://reactjs.org/community/examples.html](https://reactjs.org/community/examples.html)## JQuery*   **Initial Release:** January 2006*   **Maintained by:** JQuery (open source)*   **Languages used:** JavaScript, CSS, HTML*   **Companies/apps using:** Wikipedia, Quora, Canva*   **Ease of use:** BeginnerJQuery is one of the oldest, smallest, and easiest libraries on this list. It is also the most widely used, primarily because of the aforementioned traits. JQuery makes it much easier for your code to manipulate page elements, handle user events (such as clicking), create attractive animations, and query your backend than would be possible with only plain (vanilla) JavaScript, all without having to work with giant frameworks like React or Angular (which can be quite bulky). ### Helpful Resources*   Concepts:    *   [https://jquery.com/](https://jquery.com/)*   Tutorials:    *    [https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/)*   Examples:    *   [https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_examples.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_examples.asp)## Angular*   **Initial Release:** September 2016*   **Maintained by:** Google (open source)*   **Languages used:** TypeScript, CSS, HTML*   **Companies/apps using:** Gmail, Udacity, Youtube TV, XBox Live*   **Ease of use:** IntermediateAngular is an extremely comprehensive, high-performance framework that can be used to make robust, response web applications for desktop or even mobile applications using technologies such as [Ionic Framework](ionicframework.com/). Compared to other items mentioned here, it comes shipped with almost everything needed to make a full application and provides outlines more structure for an application through its incredible documentation. However, as Angular’s offering is so robust there is a lot of syntax to learn and it can be more difficult to pick up for someone new to the JS framework ecosystem.### Helpful Resources:*   Concepts:    *   [Angular Docs (to start, just browse main concepts)](https://angular.io/docs)*   Tutorials:    *   [Really Helpful Angular Tutorial (from docs)](https://angular.io/tutorial)*   Examples:    *   [Examples of Angular Apps](https://www.netguru.com/blog/angular-apps-examples)## Vue.js*   **Initial Release:** February 2014*   **Maintained by:** VueJS Team (open source)*   **Languages used:** JavaScript, CSS, HTML*   **Companies/apps using:** Google, Nintendo, Adobe, BMW, NameCheap*   **Ease of use:** BeginnerLike the other mentioned frameworks, Vue.js allows you to take a webpage and split it up into reusable components which each controls how it looks, displays data, and handles user interaction. Vue.js makes it easy to keep the data for your page (for example, items in a to-do application) in sync with the actual elements in the page (HTML elements which represent the data). This is a task that is much more difficult to manage using only plain JavaScript. Compared to Angular, Vue.js is easier to get started with.### Helpful Resources:*   Concepts:    *   [Vue Docs (start here)](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)*   Tutorials:    *   [https://egghead.io/courses/develop-basic-web-apps-with-vue-js](https://egghead.io/courses/develop-basic-web-apps-with-vue-js)*   Examples:    *   [https://vuejsexamples.com/](https://vuejsexamples.com/)
